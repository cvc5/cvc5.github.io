# Downloads

All releases (sources, binaries) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows are available on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/releases/). If you are new to cvc5 and/or SMT solvers in general, then we suggest downloading one of the pre-built binaries from the GitHub release page. If you are interested in latest/unstable builds, those can also be found on GitHub.
